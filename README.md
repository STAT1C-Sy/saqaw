# The Systems Aware Quality Attribute Workshop (SAQAW) Document Repository
This is the Document Repository for the Systems Aware Quality Attribute Workshop (SAQAW). The SAQAW was developed as part of my masters thesis :mortar_board: at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<img alt="alt_text" width="25px" src="LSELogo.jpg" />](https://www.lse.ac.uk/).

The SAQAW is an attempt to combine the Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW), developed by the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute with the benefits of the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM),developed by Peter Checkland, to introduce a new and innovate way for Software Architecture Requirements elicitation. 

### :question: Why is this needed?


### :clap: What is this repository for?

Primary use cases:<br/>
:file_folder: Store files related to the SAQAW to be reused by others who want to adopt the method <br/>
:loudspeaker: Provide a forum to discuss anything related to the method
<br/><br/>
In the more general sense:<br/>
:earth_asia: Open up the method to a world-wide community of researchers and practicioners to develop further <br/>
:bulb: Inspire Software Engineers to adopt a view beyond technology <br/>
:seedling: Serve as the foundation for any future research endeavours for the exaptation of (Soft) Systems Thinking into Software Architecture
