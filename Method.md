# The Systems Aware Quality Attribute Workshop (SAQAW)

### Phase 1: Introduction and Soft Systems Phase
The first phase is the Soft Systems phase. In this part of the workshop stakeholders focus on forming a shared understanding of the systems goals and application domain. In this phase representatives of all relevant stakeholder groups should be involved since it is important to form a holistic understanding of the applications context and the current situation.

##### Step 1: Introductory presentation
The facilitators present the SAQAW method and briefly outline the steps. They also give a brief overview of systems thinking and SSM outlining how it is different from traditional systems engineering. The presentation should also include any additional information that needs to be distributed.

##### Step 2: Mission and Plan Presentation
In this step a representative of the stakeholder’s organization should briefly outline information specific to the development project at hand. The contents of this presentation may vary significantly depending on the individual context of the project in which the SAQAW is applied. Some questions that can guide the presentation are: <br />
•	Why was the elicitation initiated? Is the goal to improve an existing system or create a new one? <br />
•	What are the main goals for the system from the organizations perspective? <br />
•	What are the driving factors that instigated this process? What are important factors for the system, i.e. security, performance, maintainability, … <br />
•	Are there any high-level functional requirements/constraints available or already formulated? – i.e. any standards the system needs to adhere to <br />
•	Are there any existing technical diagrams, documentations or descriptions the other stakeholders should be aware of? <br /><br />
During this step facilitators should gather information on important aspects that may guide the creation of the rich picture. This includes everything related to important stakeholder groups and their goals for the system as well as their perceptions of the current situation. 


##### Step 3: Creation of the rich picture
The third and most important step of the first phase of the SAQAW is the creation of the rich picture. This should be done in a moderated discussion style, where participants discuss different aspects of the application domain and the facilitator notes aspects down in the rich picture. Facilitators can pose questions to stakeholders to drill down on specific aspects that appear especially relevant for the systems architecture. 
The facilitators should also pay close attention to any conflicts that may be articulated by participants and that may be an opportunity for change that is supported by the Information Systems Architecture. 
The literature only gives limited advice on how to create these rich pictures other than that they should contain a rich and unstructured account of the problematic situation (Checkland, 1981; Bronte-Stewart, 1999). To give facilitators some examples of rich pictures, that have been used in Information Systems Development. Generally, facilitators are advised to focus on the relevant stakeholders and their concerns and requirements that may be relevant for the systems architecture. The rich picture should also include any contextual concerns, such as organisational goals or constraints that may be significant drivers for the systems architecture because these aspects are most likely the most relevant source of information for the formulation of quality attribute scenarios. Due to the importance of this step facilitators should make sure to allocate enough time to the creation of the rich picture, since it will serve as the foundation for most of the subsequent steps of the SAQAW.

##### Step 4: Formulation of the root definition statement
To align all stakeholders on a main goal of the system that should be created. This step should foster a shared understanding of the systems aim and guide the development of the system.  To achieve this a template like “A system to do [X] by means of [Y] in order to achieve [Z]” can be used, where participants should collectively agree on one statement to define the systems root definition. <br /><br />
The discussion that occurs in this step may also inspire additional contents for the rich picture. Facilitators should therefore carefully listen in on the discussion and complement the rich picture if necessary. Furthermore, facilitators should ensure that all participants engage in the discussion in a collaborative manner and that the voices of all involved stakeholders are heard. 

### Phase 2: Scenario generation
The second phase is called the Scenario generation phase. This part of the workshop largely follows the structure of the traditional QAW. It only entails some slight modifications to ensure a smooth integration with the steps that were exapted from SSM. If the two phases of the workshop are split up the second phase should start with a quick summary of the results of the first phase.


##### Step 5: Scenario Brainstorming
The scenario brainstorming of the SAQAW mostly follows the brainstorming as described in the QAW. Instead of using a previously defined list of architectural drivers the SAQAW uses the rich picture as the foundation for scenario generation. Requirements should be formulated as quality attribute scenarios. Instead of going in round-robin fashion to generate scenarios, the facilitators can use the rich picture to guide the discussion, asking stakeholders that are most likely to have the most information to come up with scenarios. Due to the similarity of this step most of the guidance given in the QAW also applies in the SAQAW for the sake of completion these points are briefly reiterated: <br />
•	Requirements should be formed as specific and well-formed scenarios roughly following the structure of a quality attribute scenario. Facilitators should help the participants to elaborate their scenarios and guide scenario formulation wherever necessary. <br />
•	The specific name of a quality attribute is not as important as the underlying idea is expressed in the scenario. <br />
•	Facilitators should try to guide participants to consider different types of scenarios. To do this they should try to include scenario <br /><br />

Facilitators should always keep the rich picture clearly visible during this step to allow participants to refer to it as a source of information. The facilitators should also enquire participants to create a clear relationship between parts of the rich picture and the scenarios generated by stakeholders. This allows to put the scenario into perspective and identify aspects that drive this scenario. It will also allow to identify potentially overlapping or conflicting requirements early in the process. 

##### Step 6: Scenario Consolidation
While the need to consolidate scenarios should be mostly eliminated by enquiring stakeholders to put their requirements in relation to the rich picture some consolidation might still be required. As expressed by Barbacci, et al. (2003), this should be done if it appears to be reasonable and facilitators should carefully consider the decision to consolidate scenarios on the basis of stakeholder consensus (Barbacci, et al., 2003).

##### Step 7: Scenario Prioritization
Scenario Prioritization is done in the in the same fashion as it is done in the QAW. In this procedure each stakeholder gets votes according to 30% of the number of scenarios. Stakeholders can allocate any number of votes that they deem most important leading to prioritized list of quality attribute scenarios (Barbacci, et al., 2003).

#####  Step 8: Scenario Refinement
Analogue to the QAW the top scenarios should be refined. Barbacci, et al. (2003) recommend to do this for the top four or five scenarios. For refinement the structure of well formed quality attribute should be filled in. In the QAW, Barbacci, et al. (2003) also require participants to describe how the refined sceanrio relates to the architectural drivers. In the SAQAW this should be replaced with an explicit description of how the scenario relates to the part of the rich picture it was mapped to.
